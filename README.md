# stealdatafrom99acres
this will be used to steal data from 99acres

Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
bashpip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas selenium
For Selenium, you'll also need a browser driver:
bash# For Chrome
pip install webdriver-manager

Step 2: Basic Setup and First Test
Create a new Python file (e.g., scrape_99acres.py) and start simple:

Step 3: How to Run

Save the code above to a file called scrape_99acres.py
Run it from your terminal:
Check the output - it will create CSV files with the extracted data

Step 4: Customize for Your Needs
The code above is a starting template. You'll need to:

Inspect the actual 99acres page to get correct CSS selectors:

Go to 99acres.com
Right-click on a property listing â†’ "Inspect Element"
Find the HTML structure and update the selectors in the code


Modify the URL for your specific search criteria
Add more fields like:

Property size
Number of bedrooms
Contact details
Images



Step 5: Handle Common Issues

Rate limiting: Add time.sleep(2) between requests
Blocked requests: Try different user agents or use proxies
JavaScript content: Use the Selenium method instead
Pagination: Add logic to follow "Next" page links

Step 6: Scale Up
Once the basic version works:

Increase the number of listings processed
Add error handling and retries
Implement database storage instead of CSV
Add concurrent processing for faster scraping

Run the code and let me know what output you get - I can help you adjust the selectors based on what 99acres' current page structure looks like.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.
